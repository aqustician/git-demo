I took her on a date things seemed so bright
I knew I would not need my youporn tonight
We go to her place and we fooled around
We throw all our clothes to the ground

We begin as she turns out the lights
I start but feel something so very extra tight
I hear her cry and I see her frown
I look at the condom it is all brown

Last night I stuck it in the wrong hole
I'm so sorry from the bottom of my soul
Cause I stuck it in the wrong hole
