Walking through a dream, I see you
My light in darkness breathing hope of new life
Now I live through you and you through me, enchanting
I pray in my heart that this dream never ends

I see me through your eyes
Breathing new life, flying high
Your love shines the way into paradise
So I offer my life as a sacrifice
I live through your love

You teach me how to see all that's beautiful
My senses touch your world I've never pictured
Now I give my hope to you, I surrender
I pray in my heart that this world never ends
